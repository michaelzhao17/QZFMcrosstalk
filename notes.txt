- Literature review of crosstalk, main takeaways:
	- crosstalk mostly caused by 'leakage' of modulation field of one sensor into another
	- main way of measuring it seems to be varying the distance of one sensor to another and 
	  measured as the ratio of fields generated by the perturbing sensor and the base sensor at the position of the base sensor.
	- for QZFM, sampling at 1kHz, the modulation frequency of 923 Hz is aliased to show up as 77 Hz in the analog output.
	- Nardelli et al drove a 10 Hz sine in one sensor and measured it as it shows up on a second independent sensor as a function of distance - I will
	  not be able to do it since I cannot control the coils internal to the QZFM. Have to use the 77Hz as is, but since the base sensor has its own 77 Hz,
	  will have to normalize against the amplitude of the 77 Hz in isolation -> assumption here is that the 77Hz is constant. needs to be verified
- need:
	- some setup to vary distance between two sensors, to milli-meter precision up to a range of ~10 cm - probably the form of the rail system as now
	- 
- first steps today:
	- verify 77 Hz can be seen, if can be seen, is it constant? 
	- measure two sensors back-to-back (physically touching), as master-slave configuration, any different in the 77 Hz? Other frequencies?
